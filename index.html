        <h2>About Us & What We do</h2>
        <p>
            Aussie Kidz Charity assists the families of children under the age of 18 years old that are diagnosed with a disability. After years of supporting various well known kids charities,
            Aussie Kidz Charity was started in early 2000 by a group of individuals disheartened by watching an increasing percentage of donations 
            being used to cover overheads instead of going to the ones who need it most, the Kids. With Aussie Kidz Charity, 100% of the donations received are used for the children,
            with the running costs and overheads kept to an absolute minimum and looked after by the Directors and friends.

        <p>
            Since starting, we have raised over $750,000 and have
            provided over 150 grants covering mobility aids, walking frames, specialised clothing
            and other assistance to these very special kids. We are focussing on gaining support and
            donations through the generosity of Directors, individuals, corporations, estate trusts
            and through various yearly fund raising activities.
            These includes the Mercedes Benz Polo Championships held each September and a Brisbane Businessmanâ€™s lunch held each November.
        </p>

            Aussie Kidz Charity has received the Australian Taxation Office endorsement in May 2001 to allow donations over $2 to be tax deductible.
